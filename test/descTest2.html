<p>The hard thing about testing the <b>first</b> hundred words is that there's no way that we can fake you out. Maybe if we were to use empty title tags, or something like that. But <strong>no</strong> I've got to <!-- Dragon -->go ahead and type a hundred words. Maybe it wouldn&#039;t be so bad if I could spell. Personally I don&#039;t know how usefull of a test this is. What&#039;s a good name of an animal? If you haven&#039;t been able to guess I&#039;m using animal names as random words. Do you think I&#039;ve reached a hundred words? There&#039;s so much testing to do for a project like this. Alligator. Didn&#039;t see that coming did you?
