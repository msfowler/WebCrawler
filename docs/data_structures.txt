Description of Data Structures
^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^

STOP WORDS: To store the stop words I plan on using a sorted array. This is a good choice because I
			can run very quick binary searches on the array to find if a certain word is a stop
			word. The array contains c++ string objects.

PAGE QUEUE: The page queue will store all the pages that need to be processed. I plan on using a 
			linked list (with pointers to the first and last in the list) for the pages needing 
			processing. This is a good choice because it is easy to get the first item on the list 
			(next page to be processed) and to add things to the end of the list (new page needing 
			processing). The page queue contains Page objects.
			
HISTORY: 	For the history of pages already crawled, I will use a BST, so that I can find quickly 
			if a page has been crawled already. The history contains Page objects
			
KEYWORD INDEX: They keyword index will be a map with the key being the word and the value being 
			a set of occurances. This will be stored in a hash map, so that words can be found 
			quickly, even if the index is very large. The keyword is a string object and the value 
			is an occurence set object. 
			
OCCURANCE SET: I will implement the occurence sets using a BST as well. Every word found on a 
			page will have its own occurence set and be stored in the keyword index. The occurence 
			set contains occurence objects. 
		

Important Objects Contained in the Data Structures
^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
			
PAGE:		Pages will be objects as well containing a URL and description. This is the object 
			used the inte page queue and history. 

URL:		URLs will be stored simply as objects that contain a string to hold the URL and methods
			to manipulate and get information on the URL.
			
OCCURENCE: 	Occurences will contain a page object for the page that the words appear on, a string
			holding the word the occurence represents, and a count of the number of times it 
			appears on that page.
